Greetings,

Thanks to download this asset!

I wanted to put some rainbow in my editor, so I created this tool.
Personally, after many days, I got used to the color of the 'playmode' which.
Remains static and boring. So I wanted to add an RGB effect to this one to make it more fun and more differentiated. 

- How to have this beautiful effect?

This script only work in the editor and not in a build (of course).
The script uses the DontDestroyAndLoad function, so if your launch scene has the RainbowPlaymodeTint script, it persists through the scenes.

Method 1:

It's easy, you can click on the tool bar on Tools -> Rainbow Playmode Tint Window, next you can change two differents variables. (Default value is ok, don't worry. High-speed value can cause epileptic seizures.)
the change speed color (Default: : 0.05f) and the start color (Default: : 255 128 128 255).

Method 2: 

Create an empty GameObject and add the component name RainbowPlayModeTint or drag and drop it. (Location: : Project Window Assets -> RainbowPlayModeTint -> Script.)


Now you just need to click on Play button and that it!

If you have issues with the script, maybe it's due to a new Unity version (Tested with Unity 2020.3.17f1) or conflict with others script.
